# BBQ

### Herein lies a site that allows one to make sure they eat some great BBQ!

One can put locations of interest in the 'Heatin' up' section by submitting a location. Once they've gotten a chance to try the BBQ, the location can be 'Smoked' to keep a list of BBQ eaten. If the BBQ was terrible and you don't even want to remember it, you can 'toss' it to get rid of it from your records.

Node, Express, Handlebars, SQL(MySQL)/JawsDB, Custom ORM, GitHub, Git, Heroku, Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
